## Example 1

**Messy input**  
```

Built forecasting models for sales and deployed them to production.

```

**ATS (10–18 words)**  
```

Built and deployed sales forecasting model (Python, Prophet, Docker) — reduced MAPE by 15%.

```

**Polished (impact)**  
```

Implemented a production sales-forecasting pipeline (Python, Prophet, Docker, CI/CD) that reduced MAPE by 15% and cut excess inventory by 10% within one quarter.

```

**Clarifying question (if needed)**  
```

Over what period were the MAPE and inventory reductions measured (e.g., 3 months, 6 months)?

```

## Example 2

**Messy input**  
```

Wrote ETL scripts and sped up data pipelines, worked with databases.

```

**ATS (10–18 words)**  
```

Optimized ETL pipelines (Python, Airflow, PostgreSQL) — increased throughput 3×.

```

**Polished (impact)**  
```

Designed and optimized ETL pipelines (Python, Airflow, PostgreSQL), increasing throughput from ~200k to ~600k records/day and reducing load time by 67%.

```

**Headline**

**Keywords (ATS)**  
```

ETL, Airflow, PostgreSQL, Data Pipeline, Python, Batch Processing, Optimization

```

**Clarifying question (if needed)**  
```

What were the before/after throughput numbers (records per day) or approximate percent improvement?

```

## Example 3

**Messy input**  
```

Ran A/B tests and helped the team pick the best UI version.

```

**ATS (10–18 words)**  
```

Conducted A/B experiments (Python, statsmodels) — winning variant increased conversion by 8%.

```

**Polished (impact)**  
```

Led multivariate A/B testing (Python, statsmodels) for UX changes, resulting in an 8% lift in conversion rate and a 5% increase in average order value within one month.

```

**Headline**
